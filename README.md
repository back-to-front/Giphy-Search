## Description

This is a GIF search engine using the giphy.com API. Search any GIF you want to show at the bottom of the page. Has a simple, clean design that is easy to navigate.

## Details

Scroll down to the bottom or use the Get Started button in the middle of the screen to show the search area. Type any GIF you are wanting to see, click the Submit button beside the input field, and watch as the GIFs roll in.

As you shrink the page, the page will adapt and look good on any screen size. It is mobile friendly and the GIF area will show a different amount of columns depending on the current screen size.

You Can also use the Enter key on your keyboard inside of the input field to search for the GIFs.

## Tech Used

- HTML
- CSS
- SCSS
- JavaScript

## Future Improvments

- Adding a load more button at the bottom or a scroll down feature so it is always showing more results.
- Customize the GIF area layout even further to show more on screen and have everything in line with each other.
- Have the GIF area showing the top trending results until something else is searched.
- Have a menu on the side that you can narrow down what you're looking for (e.g. Rating, Topic).
- Have a top trending search results section showing the top search results of the current day.
